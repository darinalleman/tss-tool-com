Estimate TSS from heart rate, and edit ride with average power to upload to your favorite cycling software to keep your charts accurate!  


## The Plan

### Features
1. Upload a .fit file for processing
2. Esitmate TSS of that ride from heart rate (using a chart from Joe Friel)
3. Edit file to have power required to also have a specific TSS (useful for uploading then to Strava/WKO/TrainingPeaks/GoldenCheetah)
4. Edit file to have a user-specified average power (literally will be the same power at every second)
